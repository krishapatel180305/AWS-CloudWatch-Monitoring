# AWS-CloudWatch-Monitoring
This project demonstrates monitoring of AWS resources using CloudWatch. It includes setup for alarms to monitor key metrics like CPU utilization.

## Project Description
My goal was to create and manage an S3 bucket to store and organize data. This involved understanding key S3 concepts and implementing security best practices using IAM policies.

## Technologies Used
* **AWS:** The primary cloud service provider.
* **Amazon S3:** Used for creating and managing scalable object storage.
* **AWS IAM:** Used to secure the S3 bucket by managing user permissions and access policies.

## Key Learnings
This project helped me gain a practical understanding of S3 buckets, object storage, and implementing security best practices using IAM.
